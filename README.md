# vim-arm

vim-arm makes editing Reason/OCaml code with vim a breeze.

## Installation

I use [vim-plug][] and recomment it unless you settled on other option.

Minimal installation:

    Plug 'andreypopp/vim-arm'

Complete installation:

    Plug 'junegunn/fzf'              " needed for :ArmModuleOutline
    Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'

    Plug 'w0rp/ale'                  " needed for diagnostics

    Plug 'lifepillar/vim-mucomplete' " needed for autocomplete

    Plug 'andreypopp/vim-arm'
